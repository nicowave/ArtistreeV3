ArtistreeMapp: iOS App and API

Coming to iTunes Store soon...

Artistree is an iPhone application that allows users to geographically tag or save locations of art galleries,
street art, sculpture or any entity they identify as art. 
These entities are saved and stored on the iPhone using CoreData objects and on a server running Node and Express with
a PostgreSQL database. Art posts include a description of the art or art gallery, a photo and a title. Posts can be made
“public,” accessible on a “public map” and the Artistree API. Alternatively, art posts may be saved to a private 
“favorites map” used to keep track of a user’s favorite art location that hey have tagged. 
Artistree uses the FourSquare API in order to assist users in tagging art at locations that are already established 
galleries or venues. Artistree also uses its own API to provide users with locations of art that have not been established 
or made available from a third party resource.
